In this stage we began by installing Polymer and after this succeeded it was time to experiment with the available options. Through the usage of Polymer we were able to create several elements that were capable of working together. With some styling we were able to create a page, running on a local server, that could display our progress. With the addition of FireBase, we were able to create a small database that contains some data. This data will be used in this phase. On every page we also added a button that, as you might have noticed, takes you to our next stage. The next and last stage contains a short display of our (partly) failed intensions.
